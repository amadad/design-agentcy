# Design Agentcy 🧑🏽‍🎨

## Description

Gen Design is an exploration of generative Design. It uses [DrawBot](https://www.drawbot.com) layouts to create unique and innovative designs, saving time and effort for designers and researchers. The project is designed to be a tool for experimentation and exploration, allowing users to generate and customize layouts based on their preferences and needs.

## Features

- **Automated layout creation**: DrawBot is used to generate layouts automatically, allowing users to focus on the design process rather than the technical aspects.
- **Customizable layouts**: Users can customize the layouts by adjusting parameters such as font size, text position, and orientation.
- **Save and export**: Layouts can be saved as PDF files for easy sharing and further analysis.
