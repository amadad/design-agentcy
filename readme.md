# DrawBot (Redux)

DrawBot (Redux) builds on the Python branch of the powerful programmatic graphic software. The built-in graphics primitives support rectangles, ovals, (bezier) paths, polygons, text objects, colors, transparency and much more. You can program multi-page documents and stop-motion animations. Export formats include PDF, SVG, PNG, JPEG, TIFF, animated GIF and MP4 video.
